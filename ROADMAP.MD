# ðŸš€ Agent API Roadmap

## Overview

The Agent API is a lightweight deployment manager built with Hono and Bun, designed for managing deployments across VM instances. It provides automated deployments, monitoring, and scaling capabilities with minimal resource overhead.

## Core Features

- GitHub-based deployments with Nixpacks
- Real-time monitoring and metrics
- Process management and auto-healing
- Caching and instant rollbacks
- Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication
- WebSocket-based real-time updates

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (for ultra-fast execution)
- **Framework**: Hono (Edge-optimized API framework)
- **Build Tool**: Nixpacks (Automated builds)
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage
- **Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring
- **Logging**: Google Cloud Logging
